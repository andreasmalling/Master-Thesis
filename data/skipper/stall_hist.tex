    \caption[Total number stalls from \expid*{S5B5}]{Total number of stalls per client, from the 5 Skippers experiment (\expid{S5B5}).\newline Skippers only stalled when they were forced by a skip, meaning they should have 7 skips, if no other stalls occur. The only client deviating from the optimal number of stalls is \textit{3:BINGER}, which encounters a single re-buffering event after the initial buffering.}
