\chapter*{Abstract}
By simulating video player use behaviours and different network conditions in a Docker environment, storing a video in the distributed \acs{IPFS} system for \acs{DASH} streaming is ill suited at it's current state. 

This is due to a transmission of duplicated data, that increases with the number of seeds on a given resource.
Furthermore the experimentation was done on a limited scale due to high CPU usage of the video player and the distributed back-end.
