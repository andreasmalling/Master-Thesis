\acs{IPFS} is an unexplored technology for the purpose of video streaming. Many have build video streaming services based on \acs{P2P} technologies such as BitTorrent and \acs{DHT}s \cite{gazdar2017toward}.

A common theme is that the videos are split into smaller segments, which can be distributed between peers. An assumption none of the referenced work has made is that some pieces can become rare because they are simply skipped. For example the last segments of a video could not have been buffered if the user closed the stream prematurely. How the user interacts with the system can wary greatly and is unexplored by other works, therefore is one of the major focus points of our testing.
