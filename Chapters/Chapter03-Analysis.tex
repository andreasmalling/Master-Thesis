\chapter{Analysis}
\label{cha:analysis}

This is where the authors can answer the question of what use we can
derive from all the works described in
\autoref{cha:related-work}. Ideally, the summary of the related work
will show that there is room unexplored for what the authors have in
mind. If there are differences between the included works on key
aspects in the approach to be taken, this is where this should be
identified, and a decision reached.

Having written the analysis, the author has all the tools needed to
complete \autoref{cha:design-and-method}.
