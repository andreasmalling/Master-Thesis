\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}
Videos require a lot of space, and with an ever going stream of new content, the videos hosted on sites such as YouTube remain relevant in only short period of time, resulting in a potential high amount of access in a limited amount of time, exemplified in viral videos.

This means that a high hosting capacity is needed in both space and bandwidth, to meet potential demand.

This report will try to answer the following hypothesis:

\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{
        By utiulizing \ac{IPFS} as a back-end for a \ac{DASH} video-sharing website, videos are expected to be available in their entirety, viewable without stalling or re-buffering and being persistent, though no adaptive bit rate is utilized. This is due to an increase in consumption also increases availability through seeding.
    }
\end{displayquote}

By utilizing the \ac{IPFS} as a base for hosting videos, a server-less video hosting website will be implemented.

The network setup will be exposed to various network obstacles, such as low bandwidth, lost connections and others. This will be done with inspiration from Chaos Engineering.

The \ac{DASH} technology will be tested in simulation of different demands, different segments of the videos watched and different bit rates of the videos. This will be done without multiple bit rate sources, forcing IPFS to only download from a single stream of video and audio, making it more available to the \ac{P2P} network.

The feasibility of the system will be assessed by the \ac{UX} in the experiments, where as a measurement for \ac{UX} the focus lies on the viewing experience of the video such as the number of interruptions for needed buffering and the duration of such. 

It is expected that popular content will perform better than lesser known, and thereby lesser watched, videos.

% The results will be theoretically compared with other video streaming systems, centralized as well as distributed eg., with BitTorent as a back-end.
